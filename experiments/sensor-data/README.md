Sensor Data Recording Experiment

The goal of this module is to setup the infrastructure for logging large quantities of accelerometer data and determine what kind of Android permissions to do this while the app is running the background.

TODO
1. Set up Android SDK + basic app
2. Access accelerometer data (x, y, z) while the app is running in the background
3. Determine an AWS datastore and create helpers to connect to the service
