Voice Recognition API Experiment

The goal of this module is to determine if/how we can trigger a voice assistant to listen for user input when the screen is off. The user's voice will be used to add an activity label to a window of sensor data.

TODO
1. Set up Android SDK + basic app
2. What device permissions do we need to work with Android Speech API?
3. How can we wake up the device intermittenly?
